		STEP 1/5

		- Instead of writing the alert and all of the content that goes with it in the
		element itself, we're going to tell the onlick, "Hey, run this custom function for
		us," which we are going to write in the next step, at the end of the document.
		- This is what is referred to as "calling" a function, and in JavaScript, and many
		other programming languages, calling a function requires parentheses.

		We want to call a function on the onclick even that alerts 'I love retro TVs.'
		Let's call it alertImgTvs.

		STEP 2/5

		- This is how you can add a script to your page.
		- It's best practice to place any scripts after the document content so that if
		something goes wrong with our JavaScript, it won't prevent our page from loading.
		- We are going to write a function instead of just adding the alert straight. A
		function is like a bucket of code we can use whenever we want.
